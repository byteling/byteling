**`Digital Craftsman`**

Here you will find some of my public projects that have been created from the ground up. They are supposed to solve problems that I face during daily digital work and might help you out too. They are created following the principles of an digital craftsman with a focus on quality, collaboration, problem solving and a passion for the crafting of quality work, lifelong learning and a user-centric approach. 

Formerly used Arch, btw.
